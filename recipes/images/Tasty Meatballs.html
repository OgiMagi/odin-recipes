    <h2 class="mini-header">Description</h2>
     <p1>There’s nothing quite as satisfying as a pasta bowl cradling perfectly cooked, twirled and tangled, steaming spaghetti coated in a vibrant, garlicky, San Marzano marinara sauce, all piled high and layered with homemade meatballs throughout! Talk about comfort food at its proudest!</p1>
    
    <h3 class="mini-header">Ingredients
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Ground beef (80 – 85% lean) and ground pork – don’t use previously frozen or meat won’t hold together as well and they won’t taste as fresh.</li>
            <li>Fresh bread crumbs – made from hearty, dense bread such as a la brea loaf (not a fluffy loaf of french bread or sandwich bread). The hearty stuff is more absorbent. Preferably use 2 or 3 day old stale bread.</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs (basil, parsley and oregano) – I highly recommend sticking with the fresh herbs but if you don’t have them on hand dried will work in a pinch (use 2 tsp dried basil, 2 tsp dried parsley and 1 tsp dried oregano). But the next time do try them with fresh it really does make a difference in flavor.</li>
            <li>Fresh onion and garlic – normally I’m all about sautéing these aromatics first, but to save time we finely mince the onion to the size of minced garlic so it isn’t crunchy by the time the meatballs are done.</li>
            <li>Eggs – these will hold the meatballs together. Don’t skip them.</li>
            <li>Whole milk – this keeps the meatballs moist. No one wants to eat dry meatballs.</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese – use real parmigiano-reggiano such as Murray’s for the best authentic flavor.</li>
            For the Spaghetti &amp; Sauce:
            <li>Spaghetti pasta – to make spaghetti and meatballs you’ll want about 16 – 20 oz dry spaghetti, cooked according to package directions (I go easy on the salt if using store-bought sauce). Fresh spaghetti would be even better if you have access to it.</li>
            <li>Marinara sauce – for a shortcut I use 2 (24 oz) jars of best quality tomato basil sauce</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h4 class="mini-header">Steps</h4>
        <p2>Preperation:<p></p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Soak bread crumbs: In a large mixing bowl stir together bread crumbs and milk, then if needed add more milk 1 Tbsp at a time to moisten bread fully. Let rest while you chop ingredients (or at least 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add ground meats and other meatball ingredients to mixing bowl: Add in beef, pork, eggs, onion, garlic, basil, parsley, oregano, parmesan and season over top of ingredients evenly with salt and pepper (I use 3/4 tsp salt if using jar sauce because it can be salty, and 1/2 tsp pepper).</li>
            <li>Toss mixture by hand: Gently toss mixture and break meat up with fingertips until ingredients are evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Form into balls: Shape mixture with greased hands into evenly sides meatballs, about 1 1/4-inches each (or about (38g).</li>
        </ol>
        <p3>Baking:</p3>
        <ol>Preheat oven and prepare baking sheets: preheat oven to 400 degrees before you begin preparing meatballs. Spray two dark coated non-stick 18 by 13-inch baking sheets well with non-stick cooking spray, or brush with olive oil.</ol>
        <ol>Align meatballs on baking sheets: Place formed meatballs on baking sheets, fitting about 20 per each and spacing evenly apart.</ol>
        <ol>Bake until cooked through: Bake in upper and lower third of oven 10 minutes. Remove and turn meatballs if browned already on bottom (use a thin metal spatula to scrape from baking sheet if needed). Transfer pans to opposite racks and bake until cooked through, about 8 – 12 minutes longer (should register 165 degrees in center of meatballs, test meatballs in center of pan too as those cook a little slower than meatballs on edges).</ol>
        <ol>Toss with warmed marinara sauce and serve. If desired you can simmer with sauce for 10 – 20 minutes over low heat for even more tender meatballs.</ol>
